# Introduction

In this lab, we inject mutation faults, through Mutation Testing, by way of mutation testing tools. After using the tool in our Java code, we analyze the mutation score for designing new test cases to make the test suite better in quality. 

Next, by "record and replay", we use GUI automation testing with Selenium tool.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

10 mutants from `Range` test suite were analyzed.  A surviving one was chosen and another killed from each SUT method tested.

#### Range.expandToInclude(Range range, double value)
●	Mutation: Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1
○	Status: Survived
○	Analysis: This mutation survived because the change did not affect the final outcome of the function.
●	Mutation: Negated conditional
○	Status: Killed
○	Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the code constructs the return value. Changing the condition changes the return value, causing the test to fail

#### Range.contains(double value)
●	Mutation: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
○	Status: Survived
○	Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested was well within the condition that an increment of 1 would not affect the outcome
●	Mutation: Substituted 1 with 0
○	Status: Killed
○	Analysis: This mutation was killed because the method returns only a 1 or a 0. If the return value is changed, then the test will always fail

#### Range.constrain(double value)
●	Mutation: Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1
○	Status: Survived
○	Analysis: This mutation survived because the value that was being tested was well outside the condition that a decrement of 1 would not affect the outcome
●	Mutation: Negated double local variable number 1
○	Status: Killed
○	Analysis: This mutation was killed because the negative value changed the outcome of the condition thus changing the result and that is why it was detected.

#### Range.intersects(double b0, double b1)
●	Mutation: greater than to greater than or equal to
○	Status: Survived
○	Analysis: This mutation survived because the value being tested was outside the condition being tested. Changing the condition doesn't change the boolean outcome
●	Mutation: Negated conditional
○	Status: Killed
○	Analysis: This mutation was killed because the condition is how the return value is constructed

#### Range.shift(Range base, double delta)
●	Mutation: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
○	Status: Survived
○	Analysis: This mutation survived because a condition to be tested later is already false, so changing the value does not change the condition
●	Mutation: Substituted 0.0 with 1.0
○	Status: Killed
○	Analysis: This mutation was killed because it is a condition to be tested later. Changing the condition changes the return value


# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

`Range` and `DataUtilities` test suite PIT summaries: 

![Alt Text](./media/PIT/Before.png)

![Alt Text](./media/PIT/DataUtilsMutations.png)

The mutation scores for our test classes were as follows, reflecting the improvements made through additional testing:

- Range: Initially at 77%, improved to 86%.
- DataUtilities: Originally at 92%, with further enhancements reaching up to 93%.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

The mutation score closely parallels line coverage metrics. This correlation is logical, considering that our directive was not to achieve comprehensive line coverage, but rather to ensure detailed coverage of specific methods. 


# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

We identified a minimal number of equivalent mutants, primarily involving conditional statement mutations. These mutants' impact on the accuracy of mutation scores is minimal, given that their operational conditions were assumed to be beyond the relevant conditional bounds, rendering changes inconsequential.

To detect such equivalent mutants, examining the proximity of conditional statements to return statements might offer some insight, though it doesn't ensure the identification of all equivalent variants across different SUTs.



# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

To enhance the mutation scores of our test suites, we embarked on increasing line coverage by integrating tests for previously unexamined methods from earlier assignments. While attempting to boost line coverage can present challenges, notably with private methods or in identifying equivalent mutants, our efforts led to significant improvements in mutation scores.

For the DataUtilities test suite, despite the addition of new tests, achieving a mutation score beyond 93% proved challenging due to the presence of ineffective mutations that did not significantly impact test outcomes. Similarly, for the Range class, our strategic enhancements lifted the mutation score from an initial 77% to 86%.

This endeavor involved careful analysis of each code line that returned a value, followed by the formulation of corresponding tests to cover those lines. Although this method proved beneficial in enhancing our test suites, it is crucial to approach this strategy with caution to avoid overly conforming tests to the existing code structure. Adherence to sound testing principles and practices remains paramount.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutation testing is a technique used to evaluate the quality of software tests. It involves making small, deliberate changes (mutations) to a program's source code and then running the program's existing tests to see if they detect and fail due to these changes. The main goal is to assess the effectiveness of the test suite in identifying errors.

## Advantages of Mutation Testing

1. **Improves Test Quality:** By identifying weak spots in the test suite, developers can write more effective tests, leading to higher quality software.
2. **Detects Code That is Not Being Tested:** Helps in uncovering sections of the code that are not covered by any test, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.
3. **Encourages Refinement of Code:** By identifying unnecessary code or complex code paths that can be simplified, mutation testing encourages code refinement and optimization.

## Disadvantages of Mutation Testing

1. **High Computational Cost:** Generating and testing many mutants can be resource-intensive, especially for large codebases, leading to long execution times.
2. **Complexity in Understanding:** Interpreting mutation testing results can be complex and may require a deep understanding of the codebase, making it less accessible for beginners.
3. **Integration Effort:** Incorporating mutation testing into an existing development workflow can require significant effort and adjustment, potentially disrupting established processes.

In summary, mutation testing is a powerful tool for enhancing the quality and coverage of software tests, but its application is best suited for projects where the benefits outweigh the costs associated with its computational demands and complexity.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
In Selenium IDE, "checkpoints" are validation points or verification steps that are used to verify the expected behavior of a web application during test execution. Checkpoints are used to validate that the application is functioning correctly by comparing the actual values or states of elements on the webpage against the expected values. Assertions are one type of checkpoint that can be used in Selenium IDE. In Selenium IDE, "assert" commands are used to verify the expected behavior of the web application during test execution. The "assert" commands allow you to check whether specific conditions are true or false and provide feedback on whether the test passed or failed based on the assertion results. Adding assertions in our Selenium IDE tests were crucial to completing this part of the assignment, as AssertText and AssertValue were commonly used to verify that the test had been redirected to the correct page, if the correct sorting method had been used, or if the cart had the correct total value after an item was added or removed. Asserts enabled us to specify a target and value for an element on a page at different points in the test, allowing us to set additional conditions and verification for a passed test. If the assertion condition is true (i.e., the actual value matches the expected value), the test continues execution without any issues. If the assertion condition is false (i.e., the actual value does not match the expected value), the test There are also various "assert" commands for different types of verifications, like "assertText," "assertTitle," "assertElementVisible,” depending on the validation you want to perform, which makes asserts a powerful feature of Selenium IDE.

Checkpoints are crucial in testing because they help ensure that the application behaves as expected. They help make test cases more robust and reliable, and make it easier to identify the cause of test failures as they happen.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

Each test functionality was tested using different scenarios and values when it was applicable. For example, the login functionality in the Shop Smart Canada website was tested using valid, invalid, or blank credentials. By verifying that login works for valid credentials and does not work for invalid or blank credentials, we become more confident in the security and robustness of our application. Similarly, the search functionality was tested using valid and invalid keywords. For example, searching “soccer” in the Shop Smart Canada page returned over 100 product links in the results. Conversely, searching for “abcxyz” returned 0 results as expected since there is no product with this name. The purchase functionality was tested by adding and removing different quantities of items to and from the shopping cart. As this is occurring, we are checking that the total quantity and price of the shopping cart matches the expected values. Another example is the sort functionality - we are experimenting with different sorting techniques for price in our tests. One test ensures that using the “Price: Low to High” sorting of items on a page means the product prices are ascending. The other last ensures that using the “Price: High to Low” sorting of items means the product prices are descending.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

- Pitest was not working properly at first because a library it is dependent on needed to be moved from the JRE system library to the class path
- We were unable to get Selenium to work for Home Depot, so we switched to Shop Smart Canada
- We were unable to get Sikulix to work on any of our computers
- Mutation testing helps us to make robust testing suites

# Comments/feedback on the assignment itself

This lab seemed much easier than previous labs, save for more troubleshooting to get the tools working properly. If we were able to get the tools to work, it ran smooth and we learned a lot about how mutations can help us see the quality of our code and our tests. Sikulix did not work at all, however, and we would suggest to examine the requirements regarding this tool for future lab groups.
